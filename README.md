# Moby Dock in Lego

This repository contains a [Lego Digital Designer](http://ldd.lego.com) file along with building instructions for a lego version of Docker's mascot, Moby Dock.

The design is similar to the one handed out at DockerCon '15, with a modified tail created by Nicolas De Loof and [described on his blog](http://blog.loof.fr/2015/11/dockercon15-lego-moby-dock.html).
This was hacked together in a few hours and no physical reference model was used.
